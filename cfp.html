<h3>Call for Papers</h3>
<p>SEA aims to attract papers from the Computer Science community, the Operations Research/Mathematical Programming community and any other scientific community that is concerned with the main theme of the symposium, namely the role of experimentation and of algorithm engineering techniques in the design and evaluation of algorithms and data structures. Submissions should present significant contributions supported by experimental evaluation, methodological issues in the design and interpretation of experiments, the use of (meta-)heuristics, or application-driven case studies that deepen the understanding of the complexity of a problem.</p>

<h4>Topics of Interest</h4>

Contributions solicited cover a variety of topics including but not limited to:
<br>
<br>

    Algorithm Engineering
<br>
    Algorithmic Libraries
<br>
    Analysis of Algorithms
<br>
    Approximation Techniques
<br>
    Bioinformatics and Computational Biology
<br>
    Branch-and-Bound Algorithms
<br>
    Combinatorial and Irregular Problems
<br>
    Combinatorial Structures and Graphs
<br>
    Communication Networks
<br>
    Computational Geometry
<br>
    Computational Optimization
<br>
    Data Structures
<br>
    Distributed and Parallel Algorithms
<br>
    Heuristics for Combinatorial Optimization
<br>
    Information Retrieval
<br>
    Integer Programming
<br>
    Logistics and Operations Management
<br>
    Machine Learning and Data Mining
<br>
    Mathematical Programming
<br>
    Multiple Criteria Decision Making
<br>
    Network Analysis
<br>
    Online Problems
<br>
    Railway Optimization using Algorithmic Methods
<br>
    Semidefinite Programming
<br>
    Software Repositories and Platforms for using Algorithms
<br>
    Telecommunications and Networking
<br>
<br>

We further emphasize that SEA welcomes submissions that introduce novel applications of algorithms in other disciplines.
<br>
<br>

<h4>Best Paper Award</h4>
The program committee will identify one submission as the best paper.
<br>
<br>

<h4>Submission Guidelines</h4>

The authors should submit a paper not exceeding 12 pages, excluding the bibliography, the front page (authors, affiliation, keywords, abstract, ...), and brief appendix of up to 5 pages (figures and tables should be counted as part of the space occupied by the appendix).
<br>

At least 10-point font should be used. Authors are strongly advised to use the LaTeX style file supplied for the LIPIcs style https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/. Final proceedings papers must be camera-ready in this format. We emphasize that a clearly marked Appendix of up to 5 pages, which will not count toward the 12 page submission limit, can be included and will be read at the referees’ discretion. All submissions have to be made via the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sea2022">EasyChair submission page for the conference</a>.
<br>

Authors are strongly encouraged to include a link to the source code and/or datasets to increase confidence in the reproducibility of their experiments; the code may be read and/or executed at the referees' discretion.
<br>

Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work or surveys of important results. At the time the paper is submitted to SEA, and for the entire review period, the paper (or essentially the same paper) should not be under review by any other conference with published proceedings or by a scientific journal. At least one author of each accepted paper will be expected to attend the conference and present the paper.
<br>
<br>

<p style="color:#b5152b">
       The abstract must be submitted by <s><b style="color:#b5152b">January 21, 2022, AoE</b></s>, <b style="color:#b5152b">February 7, 2022, AoE</b>
<br>
       The full paper must be submitted by <s><b style="color:#b5152b">January 28, 2022, AoE</b></s>, <b style="color:#b5152b">February 14, 2022, AoE</b>

       </p>
<h4>Proceedings and Special Issue</h4>
The conference proceedings will be published in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs, <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/">https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/</a>), a series of high-quality conference proceedings across all fields in informatics established in cooperation with Schloss Dagstuhl Leibniz Center for Informatics. SEA Proceedings volumes are published according to the principle of OpenAccess, i.e., they are available online and free of charge.

<br>
Since SEA 2008 a special issue of selected papers accepted at the conference is published in the ACM Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/jea">https://dl.acm.org/journal/jea</a>).
