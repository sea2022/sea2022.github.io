\section{Transport}
We recommend to buy the "9-Euro-Ticket" for July as this permits travel on buses, trams, and local trains within Germany in June inside Germany. 
\section{WLAN}
There is eduroam available. If you don't have access to eduroam, you may use Heidelberg4you which is a free Wifi provider thoughout the entire city.
\section{Corona}
One has to wear facemasks on German public transport. Similarly, the Heidelberg University requires facemasks inside buildings whenever there is another person within 1.5m to oneself. 

\section{Lunches}
Lunches will take place on level -1 of the Mathematikon building (the building of the conference). On each day, please bring the lunch voucher for the correct day that you received with your name tag.

\section{Monday / City Tour}
On Monday there will be a city tour (see schedule). The starting point of the city tour will be Löwenbrunnen near Universitätsplatz at 7:15pm (see \url{shorturl.at/eAKRX}). If you want to, we can walk there together, i.e. we will gather in front of the main entrance and we will leave the Mathematikon building at 6:30pm to walk over to the city tour starting spot.
