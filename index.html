Welcome to the website of the 20th International Symposium on Experimental Algorithms (SEA 2022). 
SEA (International Symposium on Experimental Algorithms), previously known as Workshop on Experimental Algorithms (WEA), is an international forum for researchers in the area of the design, analysis, and experimental evaluation and engineering of algorithms, as well as in various aspects of computational optimization and its applications.
The conference is planned to be held in Heidelberg, Germany in the Campus of the Heidelberg University (or hybrid/online depending on the COVID situation).
